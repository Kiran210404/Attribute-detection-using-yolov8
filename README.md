# Attribute Detection using YOLOv8

## Overview

This project implements attribute detection using the YOLOv8 object detection framework. The main goal is to identify and classify various attributes from images using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. The project is built entirely with Jupyter Notebooks, making it easy to understand, modify, and experiment with the code.

## Features

- **Attribute Detection:** Detects and classifies multiple attributes in images.
- **YOLOv8 Implementation:** Utilizes the latest YOLOv8 model for high accuracy and performance.
- **Jupyter Notebook Workflow:** Step-by-step code and explanations for reproducibility and learning.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
- Common Python libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `opencv-python`, `matplotlib`, `torch`, etc.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kiran210404/Attribute-detection-using-yolov8.git
    cd Attribute-detection-using-yolov8
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Open the notebook files and follow the instructions to run experiments.

## Usage

- Prepare your dataset according to YOLOv8 format (see [YOLO Dataset Format](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/detect/)).
- Open the relevant notebook (e.g., `attribute_detection.ipynb`) and follow the steps for training and inference.
- Modify parameters as needed for your specific use case.
